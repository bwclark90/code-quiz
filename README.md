Description:

The purpose of this assignment was to create an application that tests the user on simple code questions. It is a timer based application where every question the user gets correct, the time goes up by 10 seconds and every time the user gets an incorrect answer, the time goes down by 10 seconds. The end score is based on how much time the user has accumulated throughout the quiz. The end time is displayed and stored alongside their name in local storage at the end of the game. The user starts out with 30 seconds in the beginning of the game. 

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
